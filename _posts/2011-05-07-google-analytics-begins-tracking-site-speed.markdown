Tracking and improving performance across your website just got a lot easier.

Google Analytics has added the ability to track page load times across all of the pages on your website. The option is not currently on by default, but it can be turned on by adding this method call to your Analytics tracking script:

`_trackPageLoadTime();`

More detailed information about setting it up and how it works can be found on this Google Analytics [help page](http://www.google.com/support/analyticshelp/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1205784). Once your tracking code is configured, you will begin seeing statistics on the new Google Analytics site under the Content category.

No user likes to wait around for websites to load. With Google Analytics now providing developers with free and easy access to performance metrics, we can now take a more scientific approach in optimizing page load speeds to improve the user's experience on all of our websites.
