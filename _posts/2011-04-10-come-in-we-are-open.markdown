Hello, there! My name is Michael Levin and I am a web developer living in the Washington, D.C. area. You can find out a little more about me by looking at my [about](/about) and [resume](/resume) pages.

The main purpose of this blog will be to share my learning experiences related to web and software development and any resources that I find helpful along the way. I have committed myself to posting at least one new article a week.

I hope you'll stick around and learn along with me.

-Michael
